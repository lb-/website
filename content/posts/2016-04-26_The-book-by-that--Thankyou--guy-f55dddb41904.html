      I just spent a weekend in Melbourne, one of my favourite cities, relaxing
      and drinking coffee. I love the coffee in Melbourne, I feel it sets the
      bar for Australia and is always onto the next trend at least a year before
      the other states catch up. We stayed at a hotel just around the corner
      from the

      there I had the chance to sit down and read a book called

      I noticed the book sitting on a bench at a local coffee shop (shout out to

      ), my wife mentioned it was by the Thankyou guy. I saw it again that
      daysitting on a prominent shelf at an airport cafe / bookstore called
      Watermark (by the way, their prices and combo store makes for a great
      model, the Campos coffee was reasonable also). The layout was landscape
      with the words written top down like you were holding an ancient scroll
      and it got me interested.

      I thought it was cool but maybe not that new, then I read that the
      physical actual book (real ink on paper) was being sold in that model
      also.

      My interest was piqued, I had heard snippets of the story if Thankyou over
      the years as a friend of a friend was related to the CEO and Thankyou
      water was always the cheapest option at my local 7/11. I purchased the
      digital version at a reasonable $20 price point, emailed the .mobi file to
      my Kindle and got started.

      Key Highlights
    </h3>
    <p name="4968" id="4968" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
      The book was an incredible and inspirational read, here are my three
      favourite highlights / quotes.
    </p>
    <h4 name="d3b2" id="d3b2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">
      1. Stepping out of your comfort zone
    </h4>
    <blockquote
      name="ab10"
      id="ab10"
      class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">
      What is important is that once you get out of your comfort zone, you begin
      to actually ask questions – and you start thinking and challenging what
      you’ve always accepted as the norm.
    </blockquote>
    <p name="41b9" id="41b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">
      This is a challenging one for me personally, my default is to keep things
      predictable and safe, looking forward to stepping out more.
    </p>
    <h4 name="271a" id="271a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">
      2. The game will change
    </h4>
    <blockquote
      name="7e68"
      id="7e68"
      class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">
      Some people don’t think the game will ever change. But it always does.
    </blockquote>
    <p name="29da" id="29da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">
      This is incredibly true, and the byproduct of this truth is that we can be
      the people who get surprised when change comes or the ones making the
      change (or at least embracing the change as it happens).
    </p>
    <h4 name="4240" id="4240" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">
      3. Celebrate the wins
    </h4>
    <blockquote
      name="4222"
      id="4222"
      class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">
      … there will always be more to do. Before you go again, you must enjoy
      [celebrate] the win.
    </blockquote>
    <p name="a225" id="a225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">
      This is another one that challenged me, I so easily look to the next thing
      and feel that I have not achieved, completed or done enough but rarely
      take the time to look back to celebrate and be thankful. It is even better
      to celebrate the wins with others in a practical way.
    </p>
    <h3 name="a4fa" id="a4fa" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">
      Closing Thoughts
    </h3>
    <p name="ea50" id="ea50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
      I really think this book is worth your time and beyond a doubt your money.
      Reading through Daniel’s story and his passion for what they are doing is
      overwhelming at times but like anything worth doing it takes courage and
      commitment.
    </p>
    <p name="f149" id="f149" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
      Firstly, this book will actually make a difference in you and also in what
      this company aims to achieve.
    </p>
    <p name="32a0" id="32a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
      Secondly, you will be investing in a unique way, kind of like a
      Kickstarter where the end product is a seed fund for this enterprise to
      grow. My favourite wallet was from a Kickstarter project, I even bought
      their second one – it took a while for me to get it but I felt a part of
      the journey in a small but exciting way. You can be a part of the Thankyou
      journey which is way more exciting IMO.
