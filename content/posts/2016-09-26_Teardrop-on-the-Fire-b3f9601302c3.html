        Some loosely connected thoughts on how content is easier to create and
        consume then ever before. Algorithms curate for us and cloud storage is
        infinite, the result is content that becomes disposable.

        Creating content, photos, video and text — such as this post — is easier
        then ever before in the history of the world. In historic dramas and
        documentaries I have watched; photos of family were treasured artefacts,
        rare and expensive as no one own their own camera. Books and the shelves
        that housed them were attributes of the learned and elite. Writing
        content that even one hundred people would read was an incredible feat.
        Now these things are essentially a zero cost endeavor in both the
        producing and consuming end, aside from one’s time.

        I remember my parents were once frustrated that electronic devices
        started to apparently become ‘disposable’. A toaster was no longer an
        investment, a television no longer lasted ten years and the idea of
        repairing an electronic device became archaic. I remember thinking how
        cheap these things are, relative to the same piece of technology would
        have cost previously. Disposable appears to be parallel to consumable,
        low cost, low longevity and high turn over. All this meant to me was
        that things would get cheaper each time, but the purchase cycle of that
        time would decrease.

        I remember later in high school (early 2000s) we would get together for
        LANs, probably the most geeky but most awesome kind of party. Everyone
        would bring over their computers, hefty monitors and connect them up by
        physical cables to play games and share content. Many of the video memes
        common today started their life being shared via LANs of these kind. I
        remember keeping a folder of funny videos and photos, as I would then be
        able to share them with others and have a laugh to myself if I so
        desired.

        There is no need to keep things like these on a local computer or phone,
        everything we would ever need is a simple search away on any device that
        is in front of us. Content that used to be valuable in its own right, as
        it represented value and not just memories or effort, now sits at a much
        higher bar to become valued.

        Mass data generation by every organisation is leading to this data
        having a short term expiry even by law in some cases. This mass data is
        helpful in many cases such as that great ‘busy times’ feature in Google
        Maps search results.

        , and pretty much every news feed out there promote the recent, the
        instant over anything historic. Hacker News moderators will tag any
        items not from the current year to ensure that readers know they are
        about to view ‘old’ content. This ever decreasing time span where
        content is considered ‘fresh’ is only exacerbated by Google adding dates
        to search results and automatic feeds taking publish dates into
        consideration for their algorithms.

        The Trouble with Tribbles

        The issue with this ever increasing cycle of content creation is one of
        storage and then of curation. Our mobile devices may hold up to 128GB,
        the storage on our laptops (with SSDS) have actually — on
        average — gotten smaller. However, the advent of cloud computing means
        that we actually have easy access to 10, 100, 1000 GB within a price
        range of free or the cost of a bottle of water per month. Eventually we
        give up and decide that we must have our world on the cloud (or we are
        not given a choice) and agree that as long as it is ‘there somewhere’ we
        will be ok.

        The latest iOS operating system even goes as far as merging these worlds
        of physical data and cloud data for you. However, endless storage drives
        down the value of content even more, in the end our entire lives worth
        of photos, ideas and stories become a cache (temporary storage) that
        just has to be managed one way or another.

        The other issue is curation, when the content flowing from others in our
        social media driven world is endless there has to be a way to ‘get
        through the feed’. Thankfully these computers in the cloud can help us
        there also, by being smart and managing what we read, see and have
        access to for us.

        We see this in a round about way with current online trends, Snapchat
        (Snap. Inc.) being the seminal example of content put online with a self
        destruct function. Many chat apps have the ability to start an encrypted
        chat that will no longer exist when closed, and when in transit is not
        available for anyone else to see.

        The trend is that content we create becomes disposable, no intention of
        it being available after 24 hours, even 24 minutes will become a common
        thought. Real time is the current best speed we can process data and
        when it gets created at a rate that is larger than all humans in
        existence can consume (in 2012, 60 hours of video were uploaded Youtube
        every minute), there has to be another path for the data to flow.
