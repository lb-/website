        I wish I could read so many more books, I love it and love taking the
        time to zone out and getting lost in a great book. I often have three
        books going at once (not ideal but alas, this is the way it is) and
        often have an endless list of the books I want to read next. This year I
        actually set a goal for how many books to read (13 — roughly one every
        four weeks) and got an early start by finishing a few of the books I had
        started over the January break.

        Using Amazon Wishlist
      </h4>
      <p name="3673" id="3673" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        I buy 90% of my books on Amazon Kindle and read using the Kindle app on
        a five year old iPad mini so I had been using the
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/intro"

          rel="noopener"
          target="_blank">
          Amazon Wishlist
        </a>
        as my source of books to read and then just looking at what is read in
        the Kindle app.

        However, I found it hard to navigate and hard to add things on the fly
        when I heard about or saw a good book I would like to — one day — read.
        Amazon also changed how this worked for Amazon accounts in Australia and
        it was hard to even get to without the direct link. Finally, it did not
        have an easy way to look at what you had actually read on the list.

        Making Lists
      </h4>
      <p name="59cb" id="59cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        Occasionally I would gather a list for a post — and then never post — or
        look through my kindle purchases but never found a good place to keep
        these lists of what I had read previously. When someone would ask “what
        are you reading right now” my answer was “give me a few minutes to load
        up my Kindle app and try to work it out”, that was not great for a
        casual conversation.
      </p>
      <p name="44c1" id="44c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        My memory is not great, and I wanted to know what I had read, how I
        thought of it and ideally when I read it.

        Finding that One Great App
      </h4>
      <p name="a8f4" id="a8f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        Finally I found Goodreads, I had seen it slowly climbing the Google
        results ladder the last year for book searches and often went to the
        site look at a book reviews. Every now and then I would read through the
        App Store search results for Book apps and it was showing up there also.
      </p>
      <p name="f385" id="f385" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        So I downloaded the app, signed up and instantly loved putting in all
        the data! I love a good bit of data entry here and there and this was
        awesome. When you sign up it asks you to rate a bunch of books so it can
        recommend new ones to you and also the usual Facebook friends linking is
        available.

        It has some epic features to get you to enter your book list and read
        list easily:
      </p>
      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="eb7c" id="eb7c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          Import from Amazon (great feature), it loads all your Amazon book
          purchases.
        </li>
        <li name="d7e1" id="d7e1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Barcode Scan (good for those old skool parchment ones in the shelf)
        </li>
        <li name="6547" id="6547" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Easy to manage your main lists (books you want to read, books you are
          reading, books you have read)
        </li>

        Goal Setting &amp; Sharing
      </h4>
      <p name="ee06" id="ee06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        As mentioned above, my goal is to read 13 books and Goodreads launched
        an awesome feature where you can set a reading challenge for yourself.
        You can track your progress and share with others (if you are inclined).

        The social aspect of the site is one part I have not really gotten into
        but I have posted a few reviews for books I have loved. It is easy to
        rate books and putting a review up works really well also.

        I love that their app and site work equally well and reasonably fast,
        also that lists can be ordered by almost any field (Date Read, Date
        Added, Title, Author, Ratings, Reviews, Number of Pages, Publication
        Year). All that filtering helps me narrow down the book to read next,
        unless I just ignore it and read something else (which usually happens
        anyway).
