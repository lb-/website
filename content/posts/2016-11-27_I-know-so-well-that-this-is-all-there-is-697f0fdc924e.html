        From the perspective of a general tomato consumer here in Australia,
        these are essentially truths. However, it does not take long before
        these truths breakdown as you dig deeper into the detail, even as an
        avid tomato fan I know that the first truth is incorrect, you may even
        go as far as saying it is a lie.

        While most people would be happy to admit that tomatoes are not ‘always’
        red, they may not always know that some can be purple, green, yellow and
        all are ripe! (depending on the type). That brings us to type, again we
        see the world initially with a few discrete types, but as you dig deeper
        and start purchasing tomatoes (not just consuming them), you understand
        that the choice depends on the season, location and budget you have to
        spend.

        We can go deeper into each of our initial facts and our truths (which
        are really generalisations masked as truths) break down fast. Some
        tomatoes grow on

        , if you step outside of western culture you will see that tomatoes are
        not treated as a salad element but as a fruit in the same way one would
        eat an orange.
      </p>
      <p name="cbcb" id="cbcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        One way to look at this is generalisation, however I see this as a
        function of the knowledge graph, the closer you get to the core element
        of the knowledge graph the less nodes can connect and hence truths must
        be compresses.
      </p>
      <p name="d349" id="d349" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        As we go further into the knowledge tree of any area the somewhat
        confronting reality is that there is no end, and the truths at each
        level of knowledge continue to get broken down at the next.

        To extend the tomato anecdote;

      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="75f8" id="75f8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          If I want to start growing tomatoes at home, the types make much more
          difference, there are seasons, climate and soil/water issues to
          consider.
        </li>
        <li name="3fce" id="3fce" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          If I ran a farm of tomatoes, this gets even more complex as I have to
          consider what can grow at scale, what market demand there is and again
          the types of vines/trees they grow on make a massive difference at
          scale.
        </li>
        <li name="5fc4" id="5fc4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          I could go even further and start a business to breed a custom type of
          tomato, this takes into consideration all the various breeds that are
          common, uncommon and even historic, what market there is in the
          farmers willing to grow and how to potentially tweak all the details
          that make up the truth of a tomato.

        Each level obviously has multiple levels between, but we are only
        looking at a first round knowledge graph of how knowledge graphs could
        work :)

        To streamline our levels we could look at a two axis matrix;

          Simple — Complex

        At any point in the axis the truths appear to be set, but from the
        perspective of any other point, these are either complete unknowns (ie.
        The onlooker does not know what the Producers know) or un-truths of some
        scale (ie. the Connoisseur’s truths about a product make the Onlooker’s
        truths seem false).

        Where Does this Leave Us?
      </h3>
      <p name="dbb1" id="dbb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        Having a perspective that the truths in our place in the knowledge graph
        may be untruths at other points gives us the ability to be ok with being
        wrong and not knowing all things about all things. It also gives us the
        ability to empathise with others when they are working on a task that is
        much deeper in the knowledge graph than we work in day to day.
      </p>
      <p name="2122" id="2122" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        We can sum this up with simply ‘you don’t know what you don’t know’, it
        is equally empowering as it is sobering.
      </p>
      <p name="eb22" id="eb22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        As we have an economy built around specialisation — where there is
        strength in each company and each individual doing a smaller set of
        things increasingly well — we must live with the reality that what we
        think we know at some point down the line is not considered truth.
