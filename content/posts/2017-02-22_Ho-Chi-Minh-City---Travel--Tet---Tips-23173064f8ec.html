        My wife (Bec) and I recently spent just over a month (thirty-seven days)
        in Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon during January. After eight
        hours of travel, it was great to get into our Airbnb apartment. I am not
        sure if our taxi driver was crazy or tired but it was an interesting
        experience on the way from the airport. Maybe he was just laughing
        because he got away with charging us so much ($22 AUD), we took an Uber
        back to the airport ($6 AUD) so we got the last laugh. We stayed in
        District 1, this is essentially the centre of the city and most of this
        post relates to that district only.

        We got a universal reaction from city locals to how long we were staying
        in HCMC, one of shock and amazement. Even the locals realise that this
        city could be the definition of chaos, crazy and construction rolled
        into one. On one hand, I loved the mix of heat, something always
        happening and the fact the city is always alive. The other part of me
        longed for a night of sleep without the sound of construction until
        morning or being able to walk down a pathway without dodging street food
        vendors, endless motorbikes (on the path, yes) and hordes of people
        everywhere.

        We discovered — after booking — that we were arriving in the middle of
        Tet, the Vietnamese rendition of Chinese New Year. This celebration is
        culturally all-consuming, the closest thing to this celebration in
        Australia is like Christmas and New Years rolled into one. We read a few
        blogs about Tet that made us nervous that nothing would be open and we
        would starve because there would be no money in the ATMs or food in the
        stores. We had booked in ignorance, but the end result was well worth
        it.

            New Year Photos
          </strong>
          are a really big deal; couples, families and individuals will go out
          together and take photos, often dressed up in traditional outfits.
          Leading into Tet we would see these photo shoots happening everywhere,
          on street corners, in front of Citibank adverts, and especially in the
          main walking street.

          is quieter but not a ghost down, many blogs we read said that the city
          shuts down and becomes a ghost town. I think this is more of a
          relative comment, you can cross the street in a reasonable amount of
          time would be a better picture to paint.

          Tet we went to get some cash out and found that our Citibank ATMs. All
          three had no money available, we had to resort to finding places with
          Credit Card (aka EFTPOS) for the rest of the celebrations.

          market stalls and the Circle-Ks.

            The pack-down is swift!
          </strong>
          I cannot avoid thinking of the process for things I see, the flower
          walking street took weeks to set up. The displays were incredible
          complex, varied and all were built on site. We had the pleasure of
          seeing it come together day by day on our commute to the office (aka,
          10-minute walk to a cafe). The pack-down took one evening, we were out
          at 9 pm the night before and at 8 am the next day it was like the area
          had never had a single display, flower or power lead run. I honestly
          do not know how they did it.

        I could probably write a lot more about what we learned, most of it
        relates to just massive cultural differences between Brisbane, Australia
        and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Hopefully, some of these will give you a
        laugh or help you out when you visit.

          <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Traffic</strong>
           — This one aspect stands out the most, coming from Australia this is
          so foreign, it is like there are no rules. At one point we saw droves
          of motorbikes go down a blocked, one-way street with a police officer
          attempting to stop them. The bikes soon realised it was a dead end and
          came back the other way as the same police officer struggled to keep
          things in order. When the roads are busy, bikes just come up on the
          sidewalk (path) and expect you to give way. Zebra crossings exist, but
          they are treated by the drivers as just another bit of road. It was
          difficult to tell if streets were one or two-way streets, as cars and
          bikes occupy and free part of any free space of road. It all seems to
          work and after a while, we (almost) got used to crossing traffic when
          no cars stop for you. We only saw two accidents, both were people
          falling off their bike and locals came to the rescue instantly.
          Basically, walk slowly across the traffic in a predictable way (at a
          point where it is minimal), keep an eye on both directions and it is
          best to keep going, do not stop — that will cause confusion and angry
          faces.

            just take Uber
          </strong>
          , locally most people seem to be accepting of Uber and we never waited
          longer than eight minutes for a car to come. The only caveat is that
          you need to roughly know where to get out, so having Google Maps open
          at the last 5 minutes of the drive helps, although Taxis seem to be
          worse at this somehow.

           — We went to one cafe in district 3, we were there for about an hour.
          The entire time a group of girls were talking endless selfies of them
          holding their drinks, photos of the drinks, photos of them in a group
          and photos of them not with the drinks. This was not a chance
          occurrence, this happened everywhere both male and female, groups and
          individuals. I thought it was part of the Tet new years photos, but
          this continued after Tet. I am 100% willing to admit that part of me
          is getting old, but this was a whole new level. This is not a tip, but
          merely an observation.

          , we had to get an Uber there but it was good for more bulk buys.
          Circle-K or Family Mart are the 7-Eleven equivalents and all seem well
          priced for smaller buys.

           — Taxis, in general, seem to be dodgy, I am biased towards Uber so
          take that into consideration. Know what you should pay before you
          purchase, especially when the price is not listed on the item or on
          the street food cart. We bought a street treat at one point (it was
          delicious) and paid $5 AUD for it, we walked past later and saw a
          local getting charged $1 AUD for the same thing. If you are bargaining
          at the markets, start with a value that is about half of what you
          actually want to pay.

          . Most cafes and restaurants will have one staff member who speaks
          reasonable English. This is in District 1, so some other areas further
          out might not be the same. I am thankful to all the locals who got our
          orders (mostly) right despite me pointing ambiguously at the menu most
          times.

           — The city is a paradise for food, the endless options at every
          corner and every street. We loved almost every place we went to and I
          already miss some of the amazing Vietnamese dishes. Always have a
          backup choice when picking from the menu, I do not fully understand
          why but there were so many times where we were told that they had run
          out of something or it was no longer available. Enjoy the ridiculously
          large menus with immaculate photos of almost every dish — I feel like
          I will be disappointed if I see a text only menu again. Some favourite
          places:

        Visit Ho Chi Minh City — if you are planning a South East Asia trip,
        this is a definite must. For Australians, this city is massive, endless
        and so different that it is worth the experience. However, probably a
        week (include a weekend as the city is entirely different on Friday and
        Saturday night) should be well sufficient. Embrace the chaos, be ok with
        the fact that signage is often wrong, ad-hoc or simply confusing. Enjoy
        the incredible food and coffee that is on offer and make sure you take
        an insane amount of selfies to try to fit in.

        For those who are planning to do the remote work (aka digital nomad)
        time in Ho Chi Minh City, there are ample places to work either in cafes
        or in co-working spaces. The Internet was fast almost everywhere we went
        and culturally it seems fine to stay at one place for hours on end.
