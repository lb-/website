        . I live in the real world so I cannot easily change what calendar we
        use but have always felt there must be a better way. This calendar
        breaks up the year into 12 months, each has days ranging from 28 through
        to 31 with February changing itself to suit our non-conformant traversal
        around our sun. The calendar we use today has a complex history with
        many accidents along the way. Including why February has fewer days than
        all the others and how the calendar is not really fully in sync with
        either the lunar months or our solar year.

        Rather than live each day in sorrow that the calendar we are forced to
        use in society is neither neat or logical I started researching
        alternatives. It turns out that many times in history people have tried
        to adjust our calendar to be either simpler or have a more logical
        approach to it. There also many other cultural and historic methods of
        calendars that are commonly used in parallel in some countries.

        Positivist Calendar
      </h3>
      <p name="d5fc" id="d5fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        My personal favourite calendar is the Positivist calendar proposed by
        Auguste Comte in 1849. This calendar was based on our solar year (not
        lunar months) and kept the Gregorian framework for determining years and
        leap years. Beyond that, it starts to get a bit different.
      </p>
      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="9020" id="9020" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          Thirteen months, all with different names to our current calendar.
        </li>
        <li name="b2a5" id="b2a5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Each month has exactly 28 days (13 x 28 = 364).
        </li>
        <li name="3ad8" id="3ad8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Day 365 was outside of the normal week cycle.
        </li>
        <li name="b25e" id="b25e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Leap years had a 366th day which was also outside the normal week
          cycle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p name="0c18" id="0c18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">
        While this can seem very foreign at first, there is a beautiful
        simplicity to it, especially when you start digging into the numbers.
        For example, the 1st day of the first month would always be a Monday no
        matter what year it is. The first day of the fourth month, would also
        always be a Monday. Each month is a consistent set of four weeks no
        matter when it is. Compared to our months, we have approximately 4.3333
        weeks per month and the 1st of January could be any weekday.
      </p>
      <h3 name="549b" id="549b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">
        Thinking in Weeks
      </h3>
      <p name="2c76" id="2c76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        The core framework of the Positivist calendar is the concept of a week
        and keeping weeks as consistent as possible throughout the year. The
        reality of our solar year means that we have to work with a number that
        is not very friendly. 365 gives us only two workable factors, 5 and
        73 — each of which could be very confusing if implemented. Imagine a
        calendar where we had 73 weeks a year, each with five days.
      </p>
      <p name="a834" id="a834" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        If we consider the leap year, we could look at a four-year cycle with
        each year being 365.25 accounting for the leap year fraction. This gives
        us a total of (365.25 x 4) 1461, this number has the following factors:
        3 and 487 which is even less friendly.
      </p>
      <p name="e5b6" id="e5b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        So if we come from the other direction, looking at what we have today,
        one of the common structures is that of a week. A week contains seven
        days, and while not necessarily based on anything other than convention
        it is a nice number to work with. Dividing the year into weeks directly
        does not work too well, we end up with 365/7 = 52.143, again the
        four-year cycle 1461/7 = 208.714 does not help too much here either.
        However, if our year were a bit nicer and sat at 364 days, we end up
        with an equal number of weeks at 52. This is the beauty, and maybe
        ignorance, of the Positivist calendar it just looks at a framework where
        the year is close to what we no but works better for us mathematically.
      </p>
      <p name="3a95" id="3a95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        364 has a lot more going for it, with a lovely array of factors to work
        with. All these amazing numbers; 2, 4,
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"></strong>
        7, 13, 14, 26, 28, 52, 91, 182.
      </p>
      <p name="595e" id="595e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        This means we can look at our year with divisions of any of those
        numbers, this helps because we like to break our year up into smaller
        components to work within. Like our our clock, which is divided up into
        12 parts, one of the main benefits is because it has more factors
        available (half, quarter, one-sixth).

        Living in Weeks
      </h3>
      <p name="83d9" id="83d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        Because I cannot easily change the calendar I live by, despite my desire
        to do so, I must learn to be flexible and compromise. Thankfully the
        International Standards Organisation have come to my rescue, by devising
        a way for us to break the year up into weeks in a standardised way (they
        do love standards at the ISO).

        Why Weeks Work
      </h4>
      <p name="2fad" id="2fad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        Weeks are a great single iteration unit, easy to comprehend, plan and
        think in. Weeks are consecutive and avoid the conflicting issue of
        months which can end at different dates and weekdays. A week works for
        staff who do one or five days as part of their employment. Many of our
        financial systems rely on weeks, most payroll is done as a weekly or
        fortnightly process. Reporting becomes simpler, especially when
        comparing year on year and you get more granular detail in your reports.
        If most reporting is done weekly, you are forced to think about the
        decisions you make today, not just ‘this month’.

        Weeks can be further grouped using our factors listed above:

      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="4ddf" id="4ddf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          2 week block = fortnight
        </li>
        <li name="6f56" id="6f56" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          4 week block ~= month, but best to just call it a 4 week block
        </li>
        <li name="6593" id="6593" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          13 week block ~= a quarter
        </li>
        <li name="a1c2" id="a1c2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          26 week block ~= half year
        </li>

      </ul>
      <p name="722b" id="722b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">
        Finally, in the ISO standard, we can find a consistent approach that is
        implemented in lots of software and means a shared language about
        implementing weeks. The other great benefit is that we do not have to
        abandon our Gregorian calendar, weeks work within that system. This is
        good because my birthday is in the existing calendar system and I like
        presents.

        When Weeks Don’t Work
      </h4>
      <p name="f2eb" id="f2eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        Not everything is perfect in week land, the biggest issue is obviously
        intuitiveness. We spend our whole lives adjusting to the oddities of our
        year and month structure, with songs in our head to remember the days.
        Overcoming this seemingly natural approach is a bit of a roadblock,
        however after some time (I can attest), you start to think in weeks and
        have a rough idea of what week it is at all times.
      </p>
      <p name="a222" id="a222" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Mechanically, there are other reasons such as most countries financial
        years are based on months. The other major roadblock is when years have
        53 weeks, our pesky leap year comes into play here meaning that some
        years have their last week after week 52. In these years, depending on
        the nature of your business there are other ways to work with this, like
        grouping it in with quarter four.

        I am not sure if this all of this was helpful, but hopefully it explains
        thinking behind week numbers and why they can come in handy. If
        anything, it helps me see the world as a bit more ordered and I have
        found that the excuse of ‘next month’ is less reliable as we really only
        have ‘next week’.
