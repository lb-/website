        A few months ago on my regular jog around the city — Kangaroo Point,
        Story Bridge, Botanical Gardens and back across the Goodwill Bridge — I
        kept seeing advertising for the Bridge to Brisbane. I mostly ignored it,
        except for the strategic placement of their advertising of which I was
        in admiration. I then did a bit of research on the date, time and length
        of the course. It was only 10km and I was pretty confident jogging (aka
        mostly walking) around 6km at the time so that didn&#39;t seem like too
        much of a stretch.

        I asked my amazing wife and she encouraged me to go for it, I checked in
        with my boss (I work at a Church and this was on a Sunday) and was
        reminded that my Senior Pastor did the same event a few years back and
        it was all cool. I bought my ticket and then — well, life happens — I
        was working, doing smaller 5km jogs here and there and then Google Inbox
        floated the email back to the top about a month out.

        I had four weeks to go and had not actually done 10km in one go as yet,
        I had come close (8.5km once haha). Then my ‘bib’ arrived, having never
        done anything like this I found the name bib quite confusing and
        somewhat abhorrent, implying that I would be drooling or am a child.
        There were also no instructions on how to actually attach the bib to my
        running shirt, this too was confusing as a first timer on this kind of
        thing. After some googling and youtubing, it was discovered that the
        best way to do this was with safety pins. Now it was eight days out from
        my 10km course and I drove to the city one Friday afternoon and made the
        stretch, doing 10km in about an hour and thirty minutes. I also got my
        fastest 10k ever! — even though this was my first (thanks

        Over that weekend I also actually did the whole course, as best I could
        without running on the highway with cars in the way. I figured that if I
        had done it at least once, it would not feel as long the second
        time — as with most things, the first few times feel the longest as your
        brain is working out the details of the new situation. The issue I found
        with doing the course is that it is not a loop, so I had to then walk
        another 3km back to my car parked at the top of Spring Hill—

        So, a week out — I had done 10km and then next minute it was Sunday
        morning, my wife was driving me into the city so I could do this thing
        for real. It was pretty cool, a year ago I never thought I would be able
        to do 10km in a row, a year before I never imagined I would actually pay
        money to be a part of a collective race. In high school and all times
        since, I actively avoided competitive physical activity, being short and
        basically not great at that stuff meant I tried to focus on things I
        could win.

        The goal of this was to do my absolute best and it was nice knowing that
        I at least joined the yellow joggers group, one level above the walkers.

        The Systems

      <p name="cbca" id="cbca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        I have to congratulate the team behind this amazing event, this was the
        first time they had this around the city (previous years it had been
        across the Gateway Bridge). It felt incredibly organised and had
        obviously been put together by some great event coordinators.

      <p name="d640" id="d640" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        For example; when I was looking at the start times, I could not
        reconcile why the fastest groups (green, blue runners) would start first
        and the slower groups (me) would start later. I assumed that it would
        make sense to get everyone to finish at the same time. On the day — the
        plan made sense, firstly there are tens of thousands of people doing
        this thing and having them finish at the same time would be just plain
        dumb. Secondly the runners would straight away overtake the
        <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">slowers</em>
        , causing frustration on the part of both parties. All of this made
        sense on the day when I saw how the people flowed, and it reminded me
        that
        <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
          you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know
        </em>
        .

        The event had set colours for running groups, blue and green for
        runners, yellow joggers, and grey for walkers. Those colours were not
        used in any other signage meaning they were allocated exclusively to the
        run groups, this helped us easily see where to go and who was in our
        group throughout the day.

        My personal favourite was the passive RFID tag built into my bib, this
        enabled the race magicians to track our every move. I thought it was an
        awesome use of tech on a mass scale and even took a photo of one of the
        trackers. note the item pictured is probably not the tracker itself,
        there is a cable that goes along the ground.

          Water spots throughout the course were great, cups could have been

          Two days after the race I received an email with the ability to
          purchase photos of myself coming down the last 500m. This was a great
          touch and would have been logistically complex to pull off.

        I took a mad selfie, me trying not to die an ugly death. I did not die
        though — as far as I am currently aware. However when I got to the last
        bit, where I could see the finish line, something odd happened. I
        suddenly had so much energy (aka adrenaline) — maybe because the thought
        of the coffee shop I was going to visit after entered my head. I ran as
        fast as I could to the finish line.

        I ran the 10km in about one hour and twenty minutes, as it was my fourth
        time doing 10k ever in a row I am pretty pumped. I loved that I got to
        jog along the roads and tunnels in our beautiful city that I would never
        normally be able to go on.

        The other cool thing was I got to see my parents (normally they are in

        having breakfast together at the Mantra (near the finish line).
