        It has been just a little while since we were in Chiang Mai, maybe about
        four months, nonetheless this incredible resource should still be
        reasonably valid.
      </p>
      <p name="f128" id="f128" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        The first thing you should know is that there is a massive amount of
        great options when visiting Chiang Mai. Some award winning baristas and
        cafes are situated here, even when we visited the London Coffee Festival
        we found that some of the winners were from cafes we had visited earlier
        that month. The prices are cheap but not astonishingly cheap especially
        if you want a good blend or single origin. However, the fit-outs are
        always amazing, things that would either be on the edge of dodgy
        (exposed wires/pipes, not fully finished surfaces) in Australia or
        simply just not affordable (chalk artwork covering every surface of the
        building’s insides). We found that every cafe had its own unique vibe,
        with some really experimental options found throughout.
      </p>
      <p name="b7e2" id="b7e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        The king of Chiang Mai is, of course, Ristr8to Chiang Mai, I still
        remember the first time I sat down to get coffee there. It was the first
        time I had been to Thailand and we were visiting friends in 2016. We had
        come from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and had found a few sweet cafes in our
        few days there. My friend advised me, as we were landing at the
        International airport which felt like a regional airport back in
        Australia, that “you wont find good coffee here so don’t get your hopes
        up”.
      </p>
      <p name="fd0e" id="fd0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        That was a challenge! So after some Googling and reading blogs I found
        that we were near this weirdly spelt place Ristr8to, firstly the ‘8’ in
        that word does not even fit correctly — Ristr-eight-to — and photos
        online at the time were a bit questionable. We sat down in the cafe and
        were presented with a twelve page menu that contained only coffee, each
        option being explained in detail (including the ‘Flat White’ invented in
        Melbourne-NOT Auckland) in a great, consistent artwork style. The music
        brought me back to late high-school with awesome tracks from Incubus,
        The Used and Panic! at the Disco. I was in love. Oh and then there was
        the hilarious sign at the front ‘Iced Coffee Kills Barista’.

        Every coffee you order in at Ristr8to comes with a sweet little wooden
        tray, with information about their main blend and their guide about
        coffee flavours. Now, this cafe is a great place to have an epic coffee
        but their wifi is subpar, probably intentionally to stop people from me
        from using up their tables for a whole day. The apartment we stayed at
        earlier this year was a short walk from this cafe so often we would go
        out and grab a coffee to take back to our apartment and work there. The
        funny thing that I could not predict about getting take away was the
        non-pattern regarding what they would give you with your coffee. Some
        days we would get a small bag to put our coffee in — a common feature in
        Thailand as it is easy to carry your coffee on mopeds. Other days we
        would get a single napkin with the coffee and sometimes just nothing. As
        someone who thinks about systems a lot, this caused some amusement in my
        heart each time I ordered and I did my best to figure out a pattern, the
        time of day or staff member, but none seemed apparent. This ability for
        places to do things that simply did not make sense to me made Thailand
        in general a really foreign but fun place to stay for three months.

        Cafes in Chiang Mai
      </h3>
      <p name="1628" id="1628" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        As per other cities, we have avoided the big franchises, unless
        Starbucks was the only place open when we needed to get our fix. The
        city is a lot smaller than Bangkok and hence there are not too many
        major franchise options, just lots of little cafes throughout the
        outer-city area. We stayed in a place known as the Nimman area, this is
        away from the city centre but we found it to be much better for cafe
        options and slightly less busy. Most good coffee will set you back
        between 65 THB (~$2.50 AUD) and 95 THB (~$3.50 AUD), Starbucks will be
        closer to 130 THB (~$5 AUD) for reference. For the quality — this price
        is ridiculously good, I am now in Warsaw, Poland and it is cheap here
        but nothing like that. Some general tips below.
      </p>
      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="9d94" id="9d94" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          Most cafes are counter service, paying when you order.
        </li>
        <li name="9735" id="9735" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Most cafes were fine to take Credit/Debit Card (not EFTPOS), but cash
          did come in handy here and there so it is better to go in with some.
        </li>
        <li name="1282" id="1282" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Opening hours on Google or even listed on the cafe door itself are not
          necessarily an indicator of real opening hours. This is just one of
          those random things that we had to get used to.
        </li>
        <li name="604d" id="604d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Opening late — some cafes will be open as early as 7am (no earlier),
          however most of them open at around 9am or even 10am. They all pretty
          much stay open until after 9pm, this is a cultural thing so if you
          want to get an early coffee, best to have a different option ready,
          like your Aeropress.
        </li>
        <li name="c246" id="c246" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Slow Coffee — This is the general term for filter and pour-over
          coffees, about half the cafes have these options available.
        </li>
        <li name="e1b8" id="e1b8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Fast Coffee — Generally, this will be the collective term for espresso
          style coffee, sometimes listed just as Espresso.
        </li>
        <li name="e506" id="e506" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Long Blacks — They are a thing here at most places so you can be
          confident you will get a nice crema on your black coffee.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Getting Stuff Done in Cafes in Chiang Mai
      </h3>
      <p name="e0ad" id="e0ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        We did not really have any issues with working for long stints (3 to 4
        hours) at a single cafe. We found we needed to test the wifi more as
        some cafes had amazingly fast wifi and some had wifi but it was choppy
        or sometimes just did not work. Passwords for wifi are usually put
        somewhere near the counter or on the menu board, sometimes on their
        printed menu but if in doubt just ask.
      </p>
      <p name="b46a" id="b46a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Power points were very common but not always at every single seat.
        Finally, the cafes can be smaller (&lt; 20 seats on average) which means
        you might not always get your favourite spot to sit down. Wifi speed was
        sufficient at most places, our apartment and the building’s shared
        facilities had reliable wifi so we found we did about a third of our
        work back ‘home’.

        This place is the must do when visiting Chiang Mai, when you get there
        be sure to look at the back of their cafe menu as they have a list of
        some other cafes they recommend you visit (even competitors just around
        the corner). They have a few sister cafes with different names, you can
        find out more on their menu, we went to each one throughout our visit
        and can recommend them all (eg.

        Nimmanian Club is an awesomely unique experience, they are more like a
        cocktail bar than a cafe but serve no alcoholic drinks. All of their
        drinks are coffee or tea inspired, drinks like ‘Butterfly Pea Tea’ and
        ‘Citrus Flat White’ are on the menu and I only wish we got to try each
        and every single drink. There is a lot of theatre to the place,
        especially if you sit at the bar while they make your drink. We worked
        here a little but mostly just came to experience the unbelievable
        drinks.

        Finding this place was a bit of an adventure, the location seems like it
        is connected to a nursing home slash hospital complex. Once you are in

        Not sure about the cinnamon sticks with coffee but Kram Coffee was a
        great place to get a flat white and get stuff done. It seemed like the
        cafe had only opened recently so it was a nice new fit-out, comfortable
        seats and good Wifi. One oddity was that the toilets were sort of behind
        the counter, so every time I went to the bathroom I had to make an
        awkward ‘hey’ as I passed the counter. Beyond that, it is more of a
        working cafe but good nonetheless.

        We only went here once but wish we went there more, it was a really
        stunning place and stands out as one of the key cafes in the city to
        visit. It is near-ish to the Nimman area and down a crazy small set of
        Thailand suburban streets, I was nervous our uber driver would just give
        up and tell us to get out. The coffee was delicious and is all grown
        from the local area, a really relaxing vibe and incredibly fast wifi.

        So this place is not on Nimmana Road Lane 9 or 1, which just confused me
        each time we went. Aside from that, the place was an instant hit with
        Bec and I, the staff were really friendly and it did not take long for
        this to become one of our staples and they knew our regular orders.
        Facility wise it had good air conditioning (it started to get really hot
        by the time we left in March) and easy access to clean toilets. However
        the wifi would stop every 45 mins and require me to reset my connection,
        but it was only a minor inconvenience.

        At first, I thought we had walked to the wrong spot, the place was tiny
        with barely enough room for the three tiny tables they had. I walked in
        and it was packed with people standing and sitting, so we got an iced
        long black to go. The quality, equipment and care of this was
        outstanding and if there had been a seat inside at the time I think this
        would have been a great experience. Instead, I drank my coffee on a log
        outside while waiting for our Uber. They had a great array of options
        for cold brew and other styles of coffee so it is well worth the find.
        Note that this is right in the heart of the city centre. Cars can barely
        drive through this part so if you are getting an Uber, you will need to
        get one dropped off near by. This place also gets mentioned because I
        love Graph Databases.

        Writing this after four months made me miss Chiang Mai a bit. I know I
        will be back sometime in the future to check out the cafes that were on
        our list but we didn&#39;t even get to see. I am thankful to all the
        baristas and staff that smiled at my attempt to say thank you in Thai
        and were passionate about the spaces and tastes of coffee they were
        producing.
