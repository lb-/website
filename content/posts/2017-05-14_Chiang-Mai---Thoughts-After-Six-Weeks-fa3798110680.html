        My wife (Bec) and I are travelling the world this year Digital Nomad
        style, our second stop was Chiang Mai, Vietnam. We both visited this
        amazing city the year before for only a few days and loved it. I
        remember walking around the city one morning during that trip, getting
        coffee for our friends back at the apartment thinking that this would be
        a really relaxing city to live in. At that time the idea of travelling
        for a whole year was just a far off idea, I never thought I would
        actually get to come back less than a year later and stay for six weeks.

        As we were researching where to stay and what to do as while travelling
        and working, this city kept coming up in our research as a ‘Digital
        Nomad hub’ because the place is cheap, has good internet and the people
        are incredibly friendly. One of the websites we have used a lot is
        <a

        </a>
        and Chiang Mai is consistently in the top ten in their rankings of
        cities. We also knew that we did not want to start in Europe as we would
        probably have frozen to death, or worse — been cold.

        So in mid-February, we landed in Chiang Mai and checked into our Airbnb
        apartment just off Nimmanhaemin Road. Most people call this Nimman Road
        or Nimman area, at least that is what we got away with when trying to
        explain the location to taxis. This area is lauded as somewhat hipster
        or ‘young’, and also has a strip of endless cafes, restaurants and cool
        places to check out.

        The place we stayed at is actually called this, it was just one example
        of the oddly named places all around Chiang Mai. One cafe we went to
        often was called ‘Nine One Coffee’, it’s opening hours were neither 9 or
        1, and the street it was on was 11.

        We loved our apartment, after the somewhat frustrating unit back in Ho
        Chi Minh city (shower flooding, room changes and lots of noise because
        of the city itself). This place was blissful, the room had a balcony
        with a nice view and felt light and spacious. The lifts felt like they
        would continue to work for the duration of our stay and they even had
        safe fire exit stairways. The apartment complex had an ancillary
        building with a small gym, a foyer with desks to work at and an upstairs
        BBQ area all onlooking the really nice pool.

        Our first cafe was the famous Ristr8to coffee, this place was a massive
        highlight for me from the last time we visited. Their coffee menu is a
        tribute to all the different styles of (mostly espresso) coffee from
        around the world and the place is always packed with locals, expats and
        tourists. The days we would work from home always started with a quick
        walk to this cafe and back as it was only about a five minute walk from
        our apartment.

        Living in Chiang Mai
      </h3>
      <p name="248a" id="248a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        We stayed a total of six weeks, so we got the chance to learn some of
        the aspects of living like a local in Thailand. Here are some helpful
        tips for those considering doing the same or just funny stuff that we
        learned the hard way. Thankfully the language barrier was not too bad,
        we learned a few basic sayings in Thai which were enough to make us
        sound probably hilarious to those who actually knew Thai, but we tried.
        I learned part way through the trip that the way I was saying ‘this is
        delicious’ was more like a question ‘is this delicious’, but I am sure
        the locals knew the general gist of what I was trying to say.

        Shopping
      </h4>
      <p name="7dfd" id="7dfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        A shopping centre (shopping mall) called Maya was about a ten minute
        walk from our unit. This place is pretty new and immaculate, lots of
        high priced shops to check out, a cinema and a bunch of restaurants with
        a massive price range to choose from. We did a quick shop for the basics
        at the supermarket in this store called Rimping, kind of felt like a
        nice IGA from back home. Rimping has higher prices than other
        supermarkets but you get the benefit of most things being in English and
        a few western products on the shelves. Fruit at this place was super
        expensive though, so we held off on purchasing too much.

        I also had the exciting surprise of realising that the toothpaste was
        salty, it was one of those times where I wished I had read the packaging
        a few more times before buying. Over the course of the trip I kind of
        got used to this salty fresh feeling in my mouth, I was glad to get to
        the end of that tube though.

      <p name="504e" id="504e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Our big fortnightly shop was at a larger store called
        <a

          data-href="https://goo.gl/maps/RQVjsgeGgh92"

          Tesco Lotus Hypercentre

        , we had to get an Uber there from our unit but the prices were much
        cheaper than Rimping and they had a wider range of products to choose
        from. Including an entire aisle on both sides full of two minute
        noodles, after spending at least 15 minutes trying to find ‘chicken’
        whatever I ended up with was far far from that flavour. The other thing
        about buying food in other countries, aside from the fact that the
        language is unreadable (at least Vietnam uses latin characters) is that
        the colours do not match up with our colours.
      </p>
      <p name="2f11" id="2f11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        In Australia, green chips (crisps) mean chicken flavour, here it means
        Seaweed. Blue toothpaste means mint, not salt and red noodles mean
        chilli, not clam flavour. After spending a massive amount of time in
        this Tesco supermarket, we made our way home.

          Time for first shop
        </strong>
         — this is something I completely underestimate at each new city. There
        is this mix of confusion regarding language, shopping conventions (for
        example, do we weigh the fruit/veggies before we go to the counter, do
        we fill our own bags, do we have to pay for bags?), store layout,
        colours of things and even if what we want is available. This makes the
        first shop take a lot of time and actually be quite draining, it is also
        fun to see what things are popular in each country that would not even
        get a single item on the shelf back in Australia. The other fact of
        shopping in a different country is things that you love to eat or brands
        that you can trust might simply not exist.
      </p>
      <p name="500c" id="500c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        I love cheese, a lot, way too much and I find it to be a staple in our
        regular shop. However, in Thailand, you just can’t really buy that much
        cheese, there are options but they are minimal and super expensive. I
        ended up getting those Baby Bel cheeses and they cost a ridiculous
        amount so we had to ration them.
      </p>
      <p name="c24b" id="c24b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Finally, the last piece of the shopping puzzle is the markets, we love
        our fortnightly fresh fruit and vegetable marks back in Australia so we
        were glad to find (after way too much time researching) where to go in
        Chiang Mai.

        are your best bet for fruit and vegetables at an awesome price in Chiang
        Mai. We went twice early on a Saturday morning, the vibe of the place is
        so intense, small alleyways with beyond WHS friendly amounts of people
        in them. Not only people but scooters, motorbikes and these large
        baskets about 1.2m tall and 1m in diameter that people walk around with
        to either fill for their restaurants or who knows what. All of this
        means a crazy fun experience and the chance to buy a massive amount of
        mangos. Oh man, I miss mangos.

        Getting into a vehicle in a country that you don’t know, with a driver
        that does not speak your language and an address that you cannot
        pronounce is a sure-fire way to add some freshness to your day. Our
        first Uber trip in Chiang Mai from the airport was not too bad, Uber had
        only been running here for a few months and this driver had to ask us
        where to go (we had no idea) at one point and also went down the wrong
        street near our apartment.

        There are a few transport options in Chiang Mai, Taxis, Red Cars
        (Songthaew), Tuk Tuks and Uber. You can almost guarantee that the taxis
        will charge you tourist tax (ie. charging you more because you don’t
        know you are being charged more). We tried to avoid those and mostly
        stuck to Uber for our trips that we could not walk, with a varied
        experience and probably about half our drivers not using the actual Uber
        map app to guide them. I assume this was because of the newness of Uber
        in the area and we got to where we wanted to go in the end. The price of
        Uber is so cheap and also predictable that it just made sense to use it
        whenever we could.
      </p>
      <p name="af02" id="af02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        We had a few Tuk Tuk rides when we could arrange a good price before
        hand and only one or two Songthaew rides into the Old City as this was a
        common route. One Tuk Tuk we got into was so close to death, the vehicle
        stopped running at almost every intersection and was rattling so much
        that we were getting ready to walk the rest of the way.

        — This is one area I could not find a workaround, there are a few blogs
        online that talk about some ATMs without feel, however, they are old and
        no longer correct. There is no way to avoid fees by the banks in Chiang
        Mai and these can be between $6 and $8 AUD which is pretty full on. The
        best plan you can have is to get as much cash out as possible, keep it
        safely and ensure you do not have much left over. Most places do not
        take credit card, so you need cash to make life work in Chiang Mai.

          Getting Non-Thai Money
        </strong>
         — We also had the fun adventure of trying to work out how to get USD as
        our next stop was Cambodia. This is a good example of something that is
        simple back ‘home’ because you know what to do. You just go to any
        shopping centre and find the Travelex, knowing that ‘no fees’ really
        means ‘bad transfer rate’. However, after going to about five currency
        exchange places and four banks we were pretty over it and were not sure
        it was even possible. Finally, after another round of research, we found
        out the right bank to go and got some USD out. The process to get this
        money out also took a while, lots of stamping, checking and double
        checking with their managers, we also needed our Passport (which they
        photocopied) to get this money out. We did get a sweet little cardboard
        envelope to put the money in though.

        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Drinking Water </strong>
        — The water is ok to use for brushing your teeth and boiling to do the
        dishes (we did not have a hot water tap in our kitchen). However, you
        will want to get filtered water to drink, thankfully there are filtered
        water machines in most back streets that dispense water really cheaply.
        The one outside our apartment complex was broken about a third of the
        time while we stayed, at one point I had to press the buttons on the LCD
        screen that was not working by remembering what to press. While this was
        happening I had an old lady yelling at me in Thai, I assume she was
        explaining it was broken or maybe that she was just not happy with the
        existence of this machine outside her residence. I saw the same lady
        yelling at the repair person a few days later, so probably the later
        issue. Anyway, these machines are great and it means you only need to
        get one big bottle from the store and reuse it.

        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cheap Lunches</strong>
         — Maya has an awesome set of restaurants on the bottom floor, you can
        get a solid lunch for less than $4 AUD there. Most of the signage is in
        Thai so you have to trust the photos and your sense of smell. It is well
        worth it for the price and the experience of trying something different.

        — This awesome restaurant had Chicken and Waffles as their main menu
        item. It was amazing, just uploading this photo now makes me hungry. We
        went to this place probably a few times more than we should have but
        loved it so much.

        main city. The parks are beautiful, especially the Twin Pagodas which
        are immaculate.

          Epic Street Food
        </strong>
         — Unlike Ho Chi Minh City, the street food in Chiang Mai felt much more
        authentic, less touristy and so different wherever we went. The best
        markets/street food we had were around the

        at the Sunday Night Markets. The Sunday Night Markets are a must do in
        Chiang Mai and only run on Sunday (convenient name). It will take you at
        least two hours to get from one end to the other as there are so many
        people. Tucked away around one of the temples is this epic area for
        street food, heaps of cuisines and awesome prices.

          (or around there somewhere) — We had read about these large markets
          (food and clothing) around the university. After a bit of looking
          around, we finally found this place and had awesome food there, the
          place is chaotic and crazy but well worth checking out.

        I loved the chilled out vibe across the whole city, traffic was
        reasonably relaxed the weather was warm and pretty much everyone we
        encountered greeted us with a smile. The city is busy but not intense
        and while things do open later in the morning (most places are open
        after 9 am or 10 am) there is always something to do or see.

        The best time in Chiang Mai is the night time, the weather means you can
        go out every night and this is when everyone seems to be out at markets
        or restaurants. We got into a really great flow of work here and while
        it was good to go to a new place, I do miss wearing shorts and a t-shirt
        every day and being able to walk anywhere we need in about ten minutes
        or less.
