        was that exponential technology acceleration is hard to fathom but
        underpins the world in a very real way. One book that presents this idea
        well is a short book by Marshall Brain called

        , it offers both sides of the potential exponential future (of course
        with the advent of strong AI), on one hand there is a near future where
        we are all essentially perpetually supported by the State while a
        handful of business owners use AI to fuel a set of monopolies that have
        a version of robots providing all the physical and creative labour
        needed. The other side is a kind of utopia where the idea of ownership
        is antiquated and technology takes us to the solar system and also to
        completely engaging virtual worlds — people can take their pick. Another
        book, part of a trilogy,

         — presents a far future where technology is astonishingly advanced,
        wireless power is the norm, we have screens on every surface of every
        wall and massive cities underground. The connection between these two
        books is the clear framing of how exponential technology growth makes a
        difference. The first book presents this fanciful future as ‘near’ (&lt;
        50 years) but the second book presents a similarly incredible future as
        far (400 years). The second book however — the world is in a predicament
        where technology cannot advance exponentially, only linear and this is
        the critical difference.

        If things keep going as they are, as we think they go, new social
        networks will come and go, batteries will get better and screens will
        become larger/smaller and generally ubiquitous. The thing is that things
        going as they are is probably the wrong way to look at how things will
        go. In our day to day, week to week life we have a sense that things are
        changing but it is hard to comprehend this change on a bigger scale. I
        remember watching a documentary about a tribe in Africa (excuse the lack
        of specificity) that roamed the land to live off and as they did not
        really have any written language they communicated through stories
        across generations, the tribe members being interviewed conveyed their
        sense of the effects of climate change being felt by the family through
        their generations. This slow change was real to them, they felt closely
        the impacts of what took possibly three to four generations, this
        perspective over a time period spanning more than one generation is
        unique.

        It is hard for us to perceive how things change over a long period of
        time without reading about it or being told stories, but these do not
        convey the reality in a way that we actually experience it. Experiencing
        technological change is the same, we know it changes but the rate at
        which it changes is hard to process as in a recent lifetime the major
        shifts have not seemed that great (Landline phones -&gt; mobiles -&gt;
        web chat -&gt; telepresence/VR chat coming soon), but go back just a
        generation and a bit ago it was (letters -&gt; landline phones) and
        before that there was nothing.

          What is Exponential
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <p name="5b73" id="5b73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        The term exponential is a mathematical one, and as with most
        mathematical things they get boring in the eyes of most people very fast
        (exponentially even). So to help us think of things exponentially, let’s
        just think of ‘
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">
          first slow, then fast
        </strong>
        ’. Occasionally in conversation people will ask me about something to do
        with technology, either what is the next big thing or what cool stuff is
        coming out, probably because I usually ramble too much about these
        things and my friends are trying to appease me. I will then go into a
        part-rant about AI, self-driving cars, battery technology or energy
        storage in general and after the blank looks I then mention something
        that Facebook are doing that is cool. In general the response is ‘so
        what, how does that affect me’, and once we start thinking about
        exponential technological acceleration we can see that, it will affect
        me soon or just a bit after soon.

        Let’s look at a few technologies and their access percentage of the
        population and some of my personal experiences around these.
      </p>
      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="d1b1" id="d1b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          Most successful kickstarter a few product iterations in — thirteen
          million people have access (0.19%)
        </li>
        <li name="3797" id="3797" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Solid sales for a proof of concept — twenty-seven million people have
          access (0.38%)
        </li>
        <li name="0a4e" id="0a4e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Successful product that no one you know owns — fifty-three million
          bought it (0.75%)
        </li>
        <li name="80fd" id="80fd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          That technology you may have heard about in a few buzzfeed
          articles — one hundred seven million (1.50%)
        </li>
        <li name="bfac" id="bfac" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          The new thing that you should get (if you had the coin to buy
          it) — two hundred fourteen million (3%)
        </li>
        <li name="1b48" id="1b48" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          That time you owned an iPad and everyone asked you about it in cafes,
          yes this happened to me, a friend of a friend owns it — four hundred
          twenty-eight million (6%)
        </li>
        <li name="f6f4" id="f6f4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Remember when your friend got their first smartphone — eight hundred
          fifty-five million (12%)
        </li>
        <li name="d44e" id="d44e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          At least one person in your family owns a fitbit (or similar) — one
          billion seven hundred million (24%)
        </li>
        <li name="4ab9" id="4ab9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          If you don’t regularly use voice to control a device of some kind,
          your spouse will — three billion four hundred million (48%)
        </li>
        <li name="b4de" id="b4de" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Everyone has this thing — six billion eight hundred million (98%)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p name="ec8b" id="ec8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">
        Depending on where you live, the distribution of technology may be
        different but you can hopefully recognise some of those indicators like
        something being a seemingly too expensive go to everyone you know seems
        to own one.
      </p>
      <p name="f9d1" id="f9d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        The scale above is exponential, every step represents a doubling of
        access for the entire globe and many things we use today have jumped
        each step in an equal timespan.
      </p>
      <p name="6226" id="6226" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Telephone lines available (assuming this means access per person) jumped
        each step every thirteen years.
      </p>
      <p name="56e3" id="56e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Internet users has been jumping each step about every four years.
      </p>
      <p name="05eb" id="05eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Mobile phone subscribers have jumped this step about every two years.
      </p>
      <p name="57a9" id="57a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Whatever is next may even jump this step every twelve months, or less.
      </p>
      <p name="26f3" id="26f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        All of these started out slow, then suddenly they were essentially
        everywhere and this trend is most likely going to increase. The first
        seven steps seem almost inconsequential, not even one billion people
        have access to the technology, then three steps later — everyone has
        access.

          Why Does It Matter
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <p name="ac26" id="ac26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        In summary, the real question is why does it matter to me and I think
        that the key understanding is that this rate of change itself is not
        just happening at a consistent pace, it too was happening slow and is
        about to start happening really fast.
      </p>
      <p name="ffb1" id="ffb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        This rate of increased access, let’s call it inverse half life — the
        rate at which reasonable access to a technology doubles — is itself
        increasing.
      </p>
      <p name="3434" id="3434" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        The inverse half life of Internet access was 208 weeks, mobile phone
        access was 104 weeks, the next big communications shift will be 52 weeks
        and after that only 26 weeks. This rate of change is hard to fathom and
        might not even be possible to cope with but it is something to be aware
        of, prepared for and potentially investigated if you want to continue to
        utilize technology in the future.
