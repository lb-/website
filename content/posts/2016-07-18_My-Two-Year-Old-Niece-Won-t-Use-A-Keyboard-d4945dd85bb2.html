        I blurted out something odd to my niece the other week, she’s only two
        years old so doesn’t really understand what I’m saying, but she was
        sitting there playing with some toys and her dad&#39;s iPad (my
        brother). I said to her
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">
          you will grow up and never use a keyboard
        </strong>
        , at the time I was just being geeky and had been reading

        where a future civilisation didnt really use keyboards as the computers
        could understand them enough.

        However, this thought has stuck with me the last two months and really
        stepped up a notch last two weeks. The last two weeks I have been on an
        amazing holiday across Thailand (and Malaysia) and have had time to
        ponder but also time to see a snippet of the future in action (and not
        just LED screens on EVERY single surface of every wall). A future where
        our interaction with our cloud (not devices but rather our own web) is
        not reactive but preemptive, not single input (the keyboard) but
        omni-input (every bit of data we feed into it, actively or passively).

          Inbox by Gmail

        , automatically loaded up all of my trip into one email thread, and
        would highlight the next relevant items for me (such as a flight
        booking) as they came closer. Google calendar also went through my inbox
        and added things to my calendar, it did get one booking wrong (it added
        a booking for our friends that I had emailed to myself) luckily I double
        checked and removed that calendar item.

        weather for the city I was in, the time it was back home in Australia
        and sprinkle some local news for the country I was in (the news was not
        helpful but I guess it was relevant) all without being asked explicitly
        to do so.

        as I can search for things in the photos which came in handy when I was
        trying to search for specific things amongst a ridiculous amount of
        photos.

        I cannot help but reason these things through, maybe because I
        understand how some of it works but I am still amazed at how passively
        this mostly ‘just works’. Some could also argue that this preemptive
        interaction is much simpler as the date range was fixed, locations were
        ‘foreign’ and all of my services related to this interaction being
        hosted by Google, however this is just the start.

        it is reasonably accurate and the only pain was the iPhone requires you
        to start dictating again after about two minutes of speech. Google Docs

        Personally I have grown up typing on a QWERTY keyboard and have been
        able to touch type for about seventeen years and can type as fast as I
        can talk plus feel confident getting my thoughts ‘onto digital paper’
        when needed. The next generation will be different, they won’t need to
        interact the same way I do as it will be a completely new paradigm of
        interaction that will get better and better.
