        When I was a kid I remember my Grandma teaching me to swim better, the
        memories are not of a family swimming pool but at a beach out in the
        (what seemed like) very team ocean! The routine would be that she would
        stand in the water with her arms out and get me to swim towards her.
        However, the closer I thought I got the more she seemed to move
        backwards. It was a goal I could never reach, she wanted me to swim
        closer to her but kept moving away. It felt very unfair at the time, she
        could stand in the water and I could not. Grandma made the goal clear
        but did not define the rules for
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">her</strong>
        nearly enough as I would have liked.
      </p>
      <p name="fa2c" id="fa2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        I feel this story sums up my struggle with the changes of life, the goal
        is somewhat clear; make a difference, see lives get better because of my
        influence, connect others with Jesus. However, the rules have been far
        from transparent, even outright inconsistent from person to person and
        week to week.

        One area I have had the ability to adapt to change well in is in the
        area of technology. This has come naturally to me somehow and has helped
        me massively through my life. My first real interaction with a computer
        was
        <a

          data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x"

          Windows 3.1
        </a>
        around 1993, I was in grade 3. I remember being fascinated by the
        computer’s mouse, moving and dragging things around on the screen. The
        right click was what excited me the most, in every window you had a
        world of new options just one click away. I was curious about how the
        mouse worked so I pulled it apart — got in trouble — and put it back
        together again. I traced the cable to the back of the computer and found
        a world of new connections, each with a unique icon and profile, it
        entranced me. This curiosity helped me in future years as I was the
        friend or family member usually called upon to fix something with the
        computer or work out what adapters were needed. I would be the one who
        would take apart the ball mouse to clean it and put it back together
        again (those who had these would know what I was talking about). Or the
        one who would be able to communicate the difference between the various
        generations of mouse ports (Serial, PS1, PS2, USB) and why mouse X would
        not work with computer Y.

        The change of technology has continued at an incredibly rapid pace
        throughout my life. The computer I am on now (2016 MacBook) was
        unfathomable to me even ten years ago. Windows 3.1 required 1MB of RAM
        (computer memory), the recent release of Windows 10 requires 2GB, a
        factor of 2000. How we communicate has gone through monumental shifts
        throughout my lifetime, I still remember the Telstra Touchtone landline
        phones from when I was a child. The world now runs on mobile, with the
        Internet being the framework for essentially all our services to connect
        and communicate with us and each other. GPS is so common, we are coming
        to expect it in our watches, a series of satellites that are in orbit
        around our planet that align with one point on Earth and then
        communicate with our devices so we can pinpoint our location to 10-50m
        accuracy.

        I love to read about, attempt to understand and explore new technologies
        whenever possible. I am thankful that I am around at a time when this
        has come in handy and hope that I continue to adapt to future changes in
        technology.

        Then there are the other things that do not come as naturally to me,
        take for example;
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Avocado</strong>
        . This incredible fruit was a black box to me until only a few years
        ago. I always thought the green and gooey substance was offensive, my
        stance was that if you were going to spread something on your bread you
        have two options; butter and/or peanut-butter and the world was simple.

        Then, my wife (whom I adore) slowly started to convince me of the
        benefits of this amazing fruit. Finally, I tried it, and I too started
        to come to the avocado party. Now, I love it, and life is not as simple
        as I need to go to cafes with great avocado on toast, not just great
        coffee. However, life is more fun having tried this new thing, stepped
        out and explored something scary and reaped the rewards.

        Not everything has the same reward, for example, Wasabi, it is green and
        sometimes spread on things — but it will not be something I look forward
        to in a meal. See, the rules are inconsistent!

        Change is hard. Some people talk about our brains being like a muscle
        that strains as we change and learn. I like the metaphor of our brains
        being more like a giant building, each brick and each foundation being
        placed by the experiences before it. To rebuild the building takes a
        heap of effort, it can even seem impossible to change the foundations
        placed so deep, but anything is possible.

      <p name="2866" id="2866" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        My wife and I have embarked on a journey this year that will be fun,
        crazy and also scary at times. However, I want to be better at change, I
        want to be better at being ok with the rules not being consistent and
        life being uncertain. I am not sure that I want all the hard parts, but
        I know that the good parts will be worth it.
      </p>
      <p name="6603" id="6603" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        I think the part that scares me the most is knowing I will make mistakes
        as I learn. I love to be comfortable in the areas I know, whether it is
        my current technology skills or my family, friends and home. I think I
        also love the safety net of not making what could seem like silly
        mistakes to others. Here in another country, that safety net is
        non-existent, you are forever making silly mistakes. Like not weighing
        the fruit at the separate fruit weighing station at the supermarket.
      </p>
      <p name="2ca5" id="2ca5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        However, I want to be cool (well, more cool) with not getting things
        right all the time. I think that is inherent with the ability to change
        and grow, making mistakes is part of the fun. Beyond all of that, I also
        am so excited about seeing new places, drinking new types of coffee.
        Right now, I am drinking some odd concoction of coconut foam and
        Vietnamese coffee and it is epic!

        and it was far from fun. One time when I was at the beach with my
        Grandma, I remember seeing jellyfish (just box jellyfish, they still
        sting but not too bad) all around me. I was so scared and started
        freaking out about what to do. My Grandma was so relaxed, it was like
        she did not even care that we were surrounded by monsters! She took us
        kids towards the beach slowly and none of us got stung, just a bit
        scared. My grandma has always been calm in chaos (the unknown is chaos
        before our brain understands the patterns). I admire that aspect of her
        and aspire to be more like that in my every day as I continue to head
        into interesting times.
