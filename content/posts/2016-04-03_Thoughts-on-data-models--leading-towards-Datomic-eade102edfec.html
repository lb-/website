        Before we get started, this is a very high level view of data
        structures, I am not a full time software developer just a person
        passionate about information systems hoping to impart some thoughts.
      </p>
      <p name="e72e" id="e72e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        Let’s design a data model for a CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
        software.
      </p>
      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="23a2" id="23a2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          First we need people, so we add a table for people.
        </li>
        <li name="306a" id="306a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Second we need the companies those people work at, so we create a
          table for companies, there should be a way to link people to companies
          as contacts or something like that.
        </li>
        <li name="05e4" id="05e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Third we need to log our calls to those people so we have a record of
          when we called them and notes about the call.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p name="1006" id="1006" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">
        We will mock this up into a diagram first, that way we can get a feel
        for the data before we go and build it.

        Approaching this traditionally we went up with a design like above, I
        studied this at uni and and when I think about this I default to a
        relational table structure. It is nice to reason about, each table has
        rows and each row is one thing, I often try to explain this notion to
        people when they are building spreadsheets (the real data backbone of
        any organisation). Relationships (connections) are not presented as
        their own thing but merely another element inside a row, it is these
        relationships (the context), that gives data better meaning.

        Documents
      </h4>
      <p name="a429" id="a429" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
        I wanted to give documents an honorary mention, as they are a common
        data structure and a more recent byproduct of the NOsql movement.
        Documents makes sense and nested information that does not need
        relationships (ie. no context needed outside of the document itself)
        becomes massively easy compared to tables. However, in most cases
        relationships to other documents become DIY and unless you are a
        database builder is something that you should probably not want to or
        have to manage.

        I have an obsession with graph databases, I feel like the world makes
        sense in graphs and think that graphs should really be called relational
        databases but that name has already been taken. Graphs have entities
        (aka nodes) that are much like a single row in a table or a single
        document. Graphs also have edges (aka vertices) that form the connection
        between the entities, but they are treated just as special as the
        entities themselves. The freedom to model any data structure is
        intoxicating, you can start with a whole bunch of disconnected nodes and
        then as your information builds you can join them to each other any
        which way. Some graph databases even let you store data on the edges
        themselves and let you query them efficiently which is super exciting.
        As you dig deeper into graph databases however you come up against
        decisions about should things be attributes (think person/email)or
        should they be joined nodes (think of email as its own node, joined via
        an edge to a person). This immense flexibility can feel a little too
        much and while graphs are beautiful, they can force decisions too early
        on the data model.

        RDF (Resource Description Framework)
      </h3>

      <p name="341f" id="341f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">
        Beyond feeling a bit over engineered and lacking great commercial / open
        source solutions the approach seems like a natural progression from
        graphs. For those who have not read anything about RDFs (aka Triple
        stores) think of a SQL database made ONLY of one table, one massive
        table with just three fields (basic concept only).
      </p>
      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="734c" id="734c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          Subject: A reference to any other row in the table.
        </li>
        <li name="b4e1" id="b4e1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Predicate: A string, usually a verb.
        </li>
        <li name="1bf7" id="1bf7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Object: A value OR a reference to any other row in the table.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p name="6a40" id="6a40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">
        From this we can structure anything, it is awesome! At first it feels a
        bit verbose but it brings all data models down to their core elements,
        like the atom of data. The person row presented at the top would
        actually consist of multiple ‘triples’ where each one tells one part of
        the person story, eg. [1, person/name, ‘John’], [1, person/email,
        ‘email@mail.com’]
      </p>
      <p name="24f0" id="24f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        A relationship (or edge) is just a triple that connects to entities and
        nested information are also just triples connected to a triple on the
        parent entity.

        Pause &amp; Reflect — when information changes
      </h3>
      <p name="46ea" id="46ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        So for whatever reason we use one of the data structures above, it could
        be that tables (SQL) is proven, works and open source projects abound so
        we lock it in. We have been using the system now for six months and then
        we get to a point where we want to ask our database:
      </p>
      <blockquote
        name="1c3c"
        id="1c3c"
        class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">
        Dear database can you tell me when person 123’s email changed, what it
        was and what it was changed to, ideally who made that change also.
      </blockquote>
      <p name="9232" id="9232" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">
        For all of the options above, we are mostly stuck with a non-response
        from our database, and Google will get some great responses that all
        would have helped six months ago but not today. We can can add
        timestamps, user add/update stamps and we can even split out emails to
        their own row/nodes but all of these only help us after some sort of
        implementation. Most likely we would then look at backups, logs or
        requests to find out this information if it is worth the hassle or
        trouble and as long as this is not a regular occurrence.
      </p>
      <p name="7f4e" id="7f4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        I personally feel that knowing the context of the when (the transaction)
        is just as critical as knowing the context of data through their
        relationships to other pieces of data. You may not need it on day one,
        but you will need it — as someone who loves Google Docs, being able to
        see all revisions to any document I have ever worked on is not required
        all the time but when it is needed it is amazing to have it there.

        Datomic is very similar to RDF, but instead of triples we have items
        that consist of four basic elements:
      </p>
      <ul class="postList">
        <li name="cfc4" id="cfc4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
          Entity (like Subject)

        <li name="ece4" id="ece4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Attribute (like predicate, but a nicer name IMO)

        <li name="ffc0" id="ffc0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Value (like Object, can be an actual value or a reference to another
          entity)
        </li>
        <li name="cd54" id="cd54" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Transaction (a special reference to another entity which itself
          contains facts about when, who, etc)

        This simple and single approach to the view of your data removes the
        need to think so far in advance about everything you need. While
        changing schema might be non-trivial it does not affect the overall
        approach to the database structure. The future requests of the system do
        not have to be predicted to be prepared for and the icing on the cake is
        that this database is immutable, meaning that data put in is never
        removed, any changes are just new facts added into the system.

      <p name="ebcd" id="ebcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        Next time you are considering some database architecture, take a bit of
        time to read about what else is out there. It might not mean you fork
        out the coin for a Datomic license but it may help you think twice
        before picking your previous default database system and schema.
