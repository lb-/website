        that it was ok to smile while sweeping the floor. I had assumed that
        people would not think I was genuine if I appeared to be enjoying
        something tedious. I digress, the smell of the coffee beans in the

        Since then it has been a slow, albeit accelerating, progression towards
        a slight obsession with coffee in all its forms. Continuing towards keen
        observations via daily immersion into the world of cafes. I feel that
        one day I will realise that all this caffeine is somewhat detrimental
        and need to pull it back a notch. When I get close to feeling that way,

        We mostly avoided the bulk franchise cafes, while we did venture into a
        few we found that there is nothing that compares a single owner cafe.
        The coffee is prepared with more care, more consistent and also the wifi
        is usually much better. Most of the time I purchased a Latte or a Long
        Black (Americano), these ranged from 35,000 VND ($2AUD) through to
        95,000 VND ($5.50 AUD). The range in pricing was quite extreme, but for
        the most part you get what you pay for and spending more meant better
        Espresso style coffee.

          EFTPOS is Australian, a few times I asked if they had EFTPOS and got
          blank stares. That was when my amazing wife reminded me that this is
          not a ‘thing’ anywhere else.

          Cash is best, after a while we just ended up using cash all the time
          as it is quite common for a cafe not to have any ‘credit card
          facilities’.

        <li name="3b02" id="3b02" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          Be ok with your order not being right, it just happens here and the
          language barrier is a real thing. Think of it as a chance to try
          something you never wanted but might like in the future.

          and ordering caramel syrup is akin to having leprosy. Best to always
          ensure you are getting a hot drink (if that is what you want) and
          specifically ask for unsweetened.

          You will want iced coffee, after a few weeks I realised why iced
          coffee drinks were normal. It is hot and dry, in a different way to
          Brisbane, having a cool drink ended up becoming more of my default.

          is great), Facebook, Blogs, Google Maps (you need to scroll over the
          map zoomed in, looking for the coffee icon), not Tripadvisor
          (searching for ‘cafe’ only gets you places with that word in the
          name). Mostly just walk around and see what you find.
        </li>
        <li name="d1f6" id="d1f6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
          For checking opening hours and if the cafe is even still running, your
          best bet is to try and find their Facebook page. Most cafes have one
          and it often seems more up to date than Google Places or their website
          (if they have one).

        Now that you are back, after exploring the world of coffee, you may have
        noticed that there is one on there called ‘Vietnamese Filter’. This is,
        unsurprisingly, the most common coffee in Vietnam and almost every cafe
        will have this as an option and some will have it as their only option.
      </p>
      <p name="c080" id="c080" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        This means that you need to be sure you know what you are ordering. The
        Vietnamese style coffee is often a really dark roast, extremely rich and
        comes with an immense amount of sweetener and ice. It is amazing and
        will surely wake you up, however often I just wanted a good old flat
        white.

          flat whites
        </a>
        are an Australian invention (not New Zealand, wikipedia must be true…
        right). Hence, you will not find them on the menu at most places aside
        from the very specialty coffee houses. On top of that Long Blacks are
        not a thing, the closest is an Americano. The difference is essentially
        the order of hot water and coffee (in Long Blacks, hot water is first,
        so you get a nice Crema on top).

      <p name="68e0" id="68e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        It is important to note that (remember our infographic from above), both
        of these coffees fall under espresso (pressure/vacuum) coffee
        production. This is good to remember as most menus will have two
        sections, one for Vietnamese style coffee (sometimes called drip or
        traditional) and the other for Espresso (or sometimes referred to as
        Italian) coffee. Traditional coffee may also be written in the
        Vietnamese Caphe Den (black) and Caphe Sua (milk/white).

        Getting Stuff Done in Cafes in Ho Chi Minh City
      </h3>
      <p name="5e47" id="5e47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        Most cafes were happy for you to stay an extended amount of time, we
        found that we would do half the day in one cafe before lunch. After
        lunch we would either go back to our unit or migrate to a second cafe
        for the rest of the day. Power points in cafes were abundant, not all
        have earths so ensure your power adapter can suit non-earthed
        connections. Wifi is also so normal that many cafes have their password
        written on the wall, on the tables or just make the password the same
        name as the cafe. I do not recall a single cafe without wifi, most are
        fast with at least 10Mbps up and down.
      </p>
      <p name="b17a" id="b17a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        The other thing I loved was that lots of cafes are multi-level, even
        though places are often narrow (due to the way land is divided for sale
        by the government). This means you can be up and out of the way from the
        entry/exit and feel like you are in your own world.

        While unique compared to the others, this place held a special spot in
        my cafe heart. It was just around the corner from our apartment and I
        had walked past this many times before going in. The cafe is small, tiny
        bench seats and tables and one operator with his coffee machine. The
        sign out out the front says “Coffee, nothing else”, for Vietnam this was
        quite unique as almost every cafe did full meals or at least some form
        of cake and desert treats alongside their coffee offerings. Ordering
        anything more complex than what is on the menu will be a difficult one
        as the owner seems to speak no English, but the place has a peace and
        care about it that I cannot easily explain.

        These are cafes that have amazing coffee but also are suitable to work
        at for at least half the day. One thing I realised is that the height of
        the table to chair ratio really matters and makes a big difference to
        how long you can work.

        , they do flat whites, long blacks, all manner of pour overs and even
        sparkling coffee. The staff are incredibly nice and attentive, they were
        more than happy to bring us a power board or help us move table if
        needed, they kept an eye on the temperature in the room, closing windows
        to put on the air-con at optimum times. The music is good and a nice low
        level. The premium price is worth it for the amazing coffee every time.
        The only downside is their seats are not great for a full days work. The
        customer service here was the best of all the cafes we visited, they
        even brought out power boards when we needed them.

        This place was gold, it took us a few tries to find it as they had moved
        in mid-late December 2016 and their website plus various blogs had
        conflicting information. Their coffee is almost on par with the Workshop
        and is cheaper, the seating is nice and the all around vibe is awesome.
        We found that some days the music would be very different (hard techno
        one day and Rastafarian beats the next), one day they played the same
        track on repeat for four hours straight. Aside from the music oddities,
        this place is great with their own roasted beans and blends that mis
        robusta and arabica, this was new to me but I am a fan of this.

        This is a bit of a unique one as it is kind of a shared open work space,
        however some days it was closed for events and there seems to be no way
        to find out aside from just going there. Their opening time says 9am but
        you are best to get there a bit after that as the escalator going up to
        the level seems to only open after 10am. The coffee is amazing though,
        this has been built by a local bank that use it for functions and
        customer meetings. I had some unique coffee that was of the Typica
        variety, which I had not seen anywhere else and really enjoyed it. Note
        that the A/C in this place seems to be constantly set to ‘make people
        freeze so they die’, so bring a jumper.

        This place had a sign saying open 24/7 but would randomly be closed,
        aside from that it is a great place to get coffee and get work done. The
        seats are comfortable, their upstairs area has enough space and feels
        separate from the rest of the cafe. It is also cheap and you can get a
        combo if you ask for it from 11am to 12pm of coffee and Banh Mi.

        Beautiful layout, incredible desserts and a few unique meals. Come here
        for the photos and to indulge on some cupcakes or ice cream
        masterpieces. Coffee is not amazing but still worth the visit, this is
        also in District 3.

        This place is special because it is my name, even though everyone calls
        me LB. They have cheap traditional coffee and great Italian style
        coffee, they were packed every morning with people having breakfast.

        There are many more cafes we visited and a lot of them were great, but
        the list must end somewhere. I loved the incredible chance I got to see
        so many great places in Ho Chi Minh City, thanks for reading.
