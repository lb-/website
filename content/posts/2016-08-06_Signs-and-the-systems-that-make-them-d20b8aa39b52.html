        Seeing the signage around in our everyday life often makes me think
        about the systems that exist (or don’t) that lead to the signs we take
        for granted. The signs that tell us what we should or shouldn&#39;t do,
        where to go to find something and where to go if we have lost something.

        In Australia I find that our regulation around signage is quite complex
        but also quite interesting. I am currently playing a small part of a
        building project for our new Church auditorium (500 seats plus an
        extensive audio-visual production system across two buildings). After
        speaking with the site manager last week he explained some of the
        complex rules around hard hat signs. One such rule affects the liability
        on the construction company based on the position of the signage. If the
        sign for wearing a hard hat is at the front gate, then the company is
        liable (legally responsible to enforce) for everyone that goes past that
        point wearing hard hats. Hence they are very careful regarding the
        points at which they place these signs, feel free to read some more fun
        regulations

        Preemptive Signage
      </h3>
      <p name="0d9e" id="0d9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        In my observations the first grouping of signs in the wild have an
        aspect of forethought to them, either through regulation or some
        semblance of common sense. Let’s call these preemptive, they exist
        because someone preempted how others act, or rules are in place to
        regulate a general consensus on what people need to know and they are
        usually professionally printed and positioned accordingly.
      </p>
      <p name="a0db" id="a0db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        It is a great example of systems in play, first there is the system that
        dictates the rules around signage, where should exit signs be placed,
        what distance between each speed sign is reasonable and does it change
        with the speed driven. How many signs should there be that direct people
        to toilets in public places?
        <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
          When you need to go, there are never enough signs for toilets though
        </em>
        .

        Most of the time this signage is effective as it has been thought
        through, expecting people need to know when to turn left or know which
        is a hand drier or urinal. Usually the symbols on these signs are
        reasonably universal.

        Reactive Signage
      </h3>
      <p name="17fd" id="17fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
        The next set of signage is more organic, more raw and I like to think of
        it as reactive. These signs have been put in place after the fact, after
        the road is built or shopping centre opens. This kind of signage
        fascinates me and often makes me laugh — not sure if that means I have
        an odd sense of humour. These signs have no rule book, no ISO or
        building code to follow and usually are the result of an incident (or
        series of incidents) that caused enough frustration to the business
        owner, cleaner or management that
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">

        One of my favourite hand written signs from a recent trip to Thailand
        was
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">
          “Do not strike or kick the bear”
        </strong>
        . This poor child sized plush bear in a Muay Thai outfit must be the
        perfect size for kids to come along and ‘kick &amp; strike’, but whoever
        arranged the bear in the first place probably had not thought of that in
        advance. The obvious solution is to put a sign there.

        Our hotel was amazing, and like many hotels breakfast is included with

          conveyor belt toasters
        </a>
        . I have noticed that alongside these special toasters there are always
        signs about not toasting croissants. I wonder how long after the hotel
        is built do they put this sign in place, it does not come with the
        toasting machine and is custom printed for each hotel. How many
        croissant fires are caused annually by people forcing their breakfast
        snack into something designed for bread only. Thankfully there is a sign
        to fix this pandemic of toasting incidents.

        The cruel irony is that those same people who apparently need a sign to
        not do something simply dumb are the most likely to completely ignore
        the signs in the first place.
      </p>
      <p name="1f27" id="1f27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
        So we end up living in a world with signs that are meant to counter the
        random but seem to just add to that random. Maybe there should be signs
        about what signs can be put up?

        My favourite sign to see custom printed or handwritten is the one in
        many international airport toilets advising that one should not wash
        their feet in the toilet, sink or anywhere else in the bathroom
        facilities. After reading about this (yes, it did fascinate me that
        much), I found that this is more a cultural gap of knowledge where the
        Muslim religion requires people clean their feet before praying. This
        custom was completely unknown to me and if I was planning the
        construction of an airport I would not have even had this on my radar of
        thinking. Alas, we have seen this sign—or something similar — at pretty
        much every international airport around South East Asia we have been to.

        In the end it goes to show that

          you don’t know what you don&#39;t know
        </strong>
        , and when planning the perfect signage for a venue, bathroom or
        construction site — it is probably like any other system where the end
        picture is something that is impossible to truly plan from the start.
