Absolutely passionate to understand how things work, create and improve systems. My name is LB (pronounced 'Albi'), I am a Christian, married to the amazing [Bec](https://www.instagram.com/becj/) and this site has a bit of info to help you get to know me.

## Process

What I love to do (even in my sleep) is help individuals and businesses implement systems and processes.

- A process works best when it is not the goal unto itself.
- Culture trumps process every time, not the other way around.
- Software can solve a problem but often a spreadsheet can achieve a process goal without adding new problems first.
- Technology serves us best when it enhances an existing system.

I would love to help you add structure where you need it in your business.

## Projects

A quick summary of some of the elegant solutions I have had the privilege of instigating and overseeing either as employee or contractor.

### ifeelgood 24/7

Using the Wagtail CMS framework (built using Django), developed an internal knowledge management system to serve as a wiki and central information hub for the team at ifeelgood 24/7.

> "I feel that you have helped and developed some awesome frameworks with which we can build. What I see that you have done is to help clarify structure, bring some foundational thinking and practices and systemic resources that will help us launch to the next stage" _— Martin Upton (Managing Director)_

### Youth Alive Queensland

As a not for profit organisation we built our own in-house ticketing system, saving thousands in sales commissions and leveraging a mobile check-in system that volunteers could use.

> LB has added significant value to our organisation throughout his time with us. His impact with us is profound _— Cameron Bennett (Managing Director)_

### WRS

Built a custom Google App Engine system that provided a simple way for WRS to send files to their customer relationship management system XPLAN eliminated an entirely manual process from an existing system.

> We would like to thank you for pioneering this system for us. It has become an invaluable tool for the business over the years. _— Ross Caruso (Managing Director)_

### ChaplainWatch

A multi-user and real-time incident management system for a community organisation offering a professional response to the crises, risks or needs of people.

### Handybin

Enable the existing staff (non-programmers) to make the most of a custom database solution using Zoho Creator, building core functionality and handing it off to their team for future.

<a name="philosophy"></a>

## Philosophy

A few thoughts on how I like to approach problem solving and systems, especially in a technology rich world.

### Open Source

Open Source Software should be the basis of solutions wherever possible and it is better to contribute to something bigger then create silos. I am currently on the core development team for [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) - an Open Source CMS built with Python on the Django framework.

### Start From a System That Works

It can be tempting to build the whole solution or the perfect system from scratch, this always seems to fail in spectacular ways. I try to remind myself constantly of this and when implementing systems - start with what exists and work from there.

### Building on Existing Platforms

Whether it is Google Apps for email, Trello for project management, or Modulus for Javascript hosted code, I endeavour to build solutions based on proven existing services and platforms.

### Transparent

Every project is managed by a dedicated Trello board, shared with clients, so you know what I am working on at all times. With a weekly flow of updates and invoices which means a faster communication loop between myself and clients.

### Tools

Preferred tools &amp; technologies where I have the most experience.

- Collaboration: G-Suite (Google Apps), Trello, Toggl, Github
- Server/Fullstack Frameworks: Django, Wagtail, Web2py, Flask, Meteor
- Frontend Frameworks: React
- CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap, Bulma, Semantic UI
- Languages: Python, Javascript (Node.js and client side)
- Code: Atom editor, Git, ESlint
- Platforms: Google Cloud Platform, Modulus
- Adobe: InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop
- Other: Saasu, Xero, Google Chrome, Mailchimp, Wordpress, PCO
